**Run your analytic anywhere**

**PFA encapsulates a unit of data processing called a scoring engine.It provides a common interface to safely deploy analytic workflows across environments, from embedded systems to distributed data centers.**

PFA is an emerging standard for statistical models and data transformation engines. PFA combines the ease of portability across systems with algorithmic flexibility: models, pre-processing, and post-processing are all functions that can be arbitrarily composed, chained, or built into complex workflows. PFA may be as simple as a raw data transformation or as sophisticated as a suite of concurrent data mining models, all described as a JSON or YAML configuration file.
