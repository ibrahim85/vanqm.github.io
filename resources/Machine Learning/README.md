## Python Automated Machine Learning tool 

- [TPOT](https://github.com/vanqm/tpot): TPOT is a Python Automated Machine Learning tool that optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming.
- [auto-sklearn](https://github.com/automl/auto-sklearn)
  - Auto-sklearn provides out-of-the-box supervised machine learning. Built around the scikit-learn machine learning library, auto-sklearn automatically searches for the right learning algorithm for a new machine learning dataset and optimizes its hyperparameters. Thus, it frees the machine learning practitioner from these tedious tasks and allows her to focus on the real problem.

## Machine Learning Goals and Outputs

Machine learning algorithms are used primarily for the following types of output:
- Clustering (Unsupervised)
- Two-class and multi-class classification (Supervised)
- Regression: Univariate, Multivariate, etc. (Supervised)
- Anomaly detection (Unsupervised and Supervised)
- Recommendation systems (aka recommendation engine)

## Machine Learning Algorithms
### Supervised Regression
- Simple and multiple linear regression
- Decision tree or forest regression
- Artificial Neural networks
- Ordinal regression
- Poisson regression
- Nearest neighbor methods (e.g., k-NN or k-Nearest Neighbors)
### Supervised Two-class & Multi-class Classification
- Logistic regression and multinomial regression
- Artificial Neural networks
- Decision tree, forest, and jungles
- SVM (support vector machine)
- Perceptron methods
- Bayesian classifiers (e.g., Naive Bayes)
- Nearest neighbor methods (e.g., k-NN or k-Nearest Neighbors)
- One versus all multiclass
### Unsupervised
- K-means clustering
- Hierarchical clustering
### Anomaly Detection
- Support vector machine (one class)
- PCA (Principle component analysis)
