## How Do I Get Started?

The most common question I’m asked is: “how do I get started?”
My best advice for getting started in machine learning is broken down into a 5-step process:
- Step 1: Adjust Mindset. Believe you can practice and apply machine learning.

## Applied Machine Learning Process

The benefit of machine learning are the predictions and the models that make predictions.
To have skill at applied machine learning means knowing how to consistently and reliably deliver high-quality predictions on problem after problem. You need to follow a systematic process.
Below is a 5-step process that you can follow to consistently achieve above average results on predictive modeling problems:
- Step 1: Define your problem.
