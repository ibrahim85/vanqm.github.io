## What is Feature Engineering?
Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy on unseen data.

## Feature Engineering Tips for Data Scientists and Business Analysts
Ref: https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/feature-engineering-tips-for-data-scientists

- **Tip 1:** Think about inputs you can create by **rolling up existing data fields to a higher/broader level or category.**
- **Tip 2:** Think about ways to **drill down into more detail in a single field.**
- **Tip 3: Split data into separate categories** also called bins.
- **Tip 4:** Think about ways to **combine existing data fields into new ones.**
- **Tip 5:** Don’t reinvent the wheel – **use variables that others have already fashioned.**
- **Tip 6: Think about the problem at hand and be creative.**
